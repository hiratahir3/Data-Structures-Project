Data set is about 1.5GB long, so it couldn't be uploaded on github. 
Score Records Management System

Developed a C++ project implementing a hash table data structure for storing and managing submission records. The system allows users to search, insert, and display records efficiently using a multiplication method for hashing. The project includes features like table resizing (doubling and shrinking), and rehashing to optimize performance. Implemented functionality to handle large data sets, record submissions after deadlines, and provide real-time search results based on different criteria such as submission date and user ID.
